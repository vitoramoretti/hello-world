# hello-world
My first repository

Vitor is my name, I live in Brazil but would love to know many parts of the world. I love music and enjoy spending time alone with myself and nature. I have just recently started studying software development and well, here I am on GitHub creating my first ever repo and understanding how the internet works.

I am currently working as an English teacher at a school in my city but I have worked with photography and image manipulation for many many years and have a broad experience in the field of covering social events, portraits and a fare share in cinematography work around music and entertainament in genereal.

But enough with that. I am looking to learn how to develop my own web applications and be able to enter the market for contributing with solutions that can hopefully address important problems that need to be solved. 

I have a background on HTML and I'm pretty familiar with CSS. I studied PHP for about a month and have been studying JS and Node.js along with express and a MySQL database.

My first big project is a CMS for my wife's business. She is a vet that works with animal reabilitation and my plan is to develop a system that has the possibility of ADD, VIEW, EDIT and DELETE clients as well as connecting those clients with their respective pets and also each pet will have a chart that needs to be updated every new session the animals has and these charts must be attached to the animal's file.

Guess that's it for my readme edit.
